### ðŸ“„ Project: *Why Semantic HTML Matters More Than Ever*  
I built a responsive website to showcase the power of semantic HTML in improving accessibility, SEO, and maintainability. Using tags like `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, and `<form>`, I structured content meaningfully for both users and search engines.You tube video available : https://youtu.be/nJrxMNbq7MQ

**Highlights:**
- Responsive layout with Bootstrap and native HTML  
- Accessible hamburger menu and thematic content sections  
- SEO-friendly headings and semantic markup  
- Subpages demonstrating layout techniques: Tables, Floats, Flexbox, Grid, and Bootstrapâ€”each with examples and use cases

This project reflects my focus on clean design, purposeful structure, and practical learning as I grow into full-stack development.
